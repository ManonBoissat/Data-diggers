# Introduction

## Abstract

**American newspapers** cover all kinds of topics from politics to sports, business, environment, etc... At the highest level, one could ask which topics people are mostly interviewed about. One way to answer this question is by trying to infer the theme each Quotebank citation is treating in an unsupervised manner and draw a distribution over some labels/classes representing these themes. Once all citations are classified with a certain confidence probability, a lower-level question could be: for each class, is it possible to relate the quotes’ frequency with some real world event? For instance, could an increase of citations about economics forecast some variation in the American stock market? 
In addition, using these classified quotes combined with additional data on the authors characteristics, we would like to compare the features of the authors of a particular citation class and try to find recurrent attributes or relevant features.

We will go trough a few question we asked ourselves : 
- **Who has the most space in the media? **
- **What subjects are treated the most? **

## Methods

In our data story, we chose to take only New York Times quotes because it represents the American newspapers well, and is a reasonable sample of our data. 
We will consider three main aspects:
- the **number of occurrences** of the quotes
- the **features** of the speakers
- the **economic topics** of the quotes

To analyse those aspects, we will use several techniques:
- **PCA** to understand the link between the features of the speaker and the number of occurrences of his·her quotes
- **BERT topic** analysis to get the economic topics
- **Doe Jones** to report the frequency of citations and compare this frequency with real world event’s timeline, as for the Dow Jones index.


# Who speaks the most? 
    
The distribution of the different nationalities of the speakers that are in the dataset is the following. It is grouped by the num of occurrences of the quotation, that is to say we counted a speaker X times if the quotation he·she is involved in appears X times. Almost the three quarters are american speakers. The main speakers come from America or Europe. The main ones correlate with the countries that have been awarded the price of "soft power" influence. As it can be seen in [wikipedia webpage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power), the last three different winners were: the USA, France and United Kingdom.

Gender equality is sadly far from our dataset. The distribution of the different genders of the speakers is the following. For the rest of the analysis, genders other than male and female will be gathered in a "other" category as there are a really few of them.

The distribution of the different work occupations of the speakers that are in the dataset is the following. It is grouped by the num of occurrences of the quotation, that is to say we counted a speaker X times if the quotation he·she is involved in appears X times. The split is more discrete but some work types stand out: almost of the quotes are told by specific jobs which are all related to publishing something to a public. It is not surprising that people who first publish work publicly and already have a sort of relationship with the population are the ones that are the most quoted.

# Let BERTopic tell us what are the quotes about.

The above barplot shows the distribution over the 20 first topics that were given by our BERTopic model. We see that the relationship between the USA and Russia takes up a lot of space in the New York Times. In second place, we find China and it capital. These two first topics dominate all others by far. It looks like New York Times is fond of ambiguous international relationships... Now look how impressive BERTopic is at clustering the other topics!

In the figure below, one can find the interdistance map of the first 500 topics.

# Let's focus now on economics topics: 
The selection of words related to economics has been done manually.
{% include_relative wordcloud.html %}
We could then automatically select economic topics among the BERTopic generated ones and finally have XXX quotes characterised as "related to economics".
      
 
 The distribution of the different nationalities of the speakers that are talking about economy is the following. More than the three quarters are american speakers: American people are even more quoted when it concerns economy. The main speakers come from America or Europe. The main ones correlate with the countries that have been awarded the price of "soft power" influence. As it can be seen in [wikipedia webpage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power), the last three different winners were: the USA, France and United Kingdom.

Gender inequality is a bit equivalent to when all the quotes were considered.

The distribution of the different work occupations of the speakers that are talking about economy is the following. The politician are 2 points more quoted when the economic quotes are considered. Furthermore, as before, more than half of the quotes are told by specific jobs which are all related to publishing something to a public.

# Does it impact Economics ?

Our next analysis consists in zooming into the domain of economics and trying to infer common variation between the quotation frequency and the Dow Jones Index which is the oldest price-weighted measurement stock market index in the United States. Feel free to zoom into the plot by selecting a window. It’s obvious that the year 2017 was very rich in economic quotes and it seems related to a massive increase of the Dow Jones. The reasons for this increase are beyond the scope of this study but could be interesting to investigate.
